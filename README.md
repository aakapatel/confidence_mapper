# A 2.5D Confidence Mapper 

## Overview

This is a [ROS2] package developed for confidence mapping with a mobile robot. The package provides a 2.5D confidence mapper class that can embed traversability confidence, elevation, color, slope roughness etc layers.  
## Citing

The robot-centric confidence mapping methods used in this software are heavily derived from the original elevation_mapping package described in the following paper (available [here](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000272110)).

## Installation

### Dependencies

This software is built on the Robotic Operating System ([ROS2]), which needs to be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org) first. Additionally, the Robot-Centric Elevation Mapping depends on following software:

- [Grid Map](https://github.com/ANYbotics/grid_map/tree/humble) (grid map library for mobile robots)
- [kindr](http://github.com/anybotics/kindr) (kinematics and dynamics library for robotics),
- [kindr_ros](https://github.com/SivertHavso/kindr_ros/tree/galactic) (ROS wrapper for kindr),
- [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/) (point cloud processing),
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (linear algebra library).

### Building

In order to install the Robot-Centric Elevation Mapping, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/aakapatel/confidence_mapper.git
    cd ../
    colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

## Basic Usage

In order to get the Robot-Centric Elevation Mapping to run with your robot, you will need to adapt a few parameters. It is the easiest if duplicate and adapt all the parameter files inside the config directory of the `confidence_mapper` package. Sepcifically you should focus on the following parameter files: 

- config/robots/topics.yaml
- config/confidence_maps/map_config.yaml
- config/sensor+processors.[choose your sensor file]

## Nodes

### Node: confidence_mapping

This is the main Robot-Centric Confidence Mapping node. It uses the LiDAR sensor measurements and the pose and covariance of the robot to generate an confidence map with variance estimates.
